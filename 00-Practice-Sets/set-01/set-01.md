How this set is organized
- Each link goes to the canonical problem page (LeetCode links included).  
- Problems cover common DSA interview patterns: hashing, two-pointers, sliding window, prefix sums, binary search, sorting+two pointers, monotonic stacks, matrix DFS/BFS, and stack/stack-based histograms.  
- Company annotations are based on public interview archives and might reflect variants rather than exact problem statements.

How to use this dashboard
- Start with easy problems to build fundamentals (1–3 days per topic).
- Move to medium problems and focus on patterns: two-pointers, sliding window, prefix sums, binary search, sorting + two pointers, stacks/monotonic stack, hashing.
- Tackle hard problems after consistent success on mediums — focus on optimization patterns and advanced data-structure techniques.
